Technology Choice

We decided to go with Python as our main language because it is easy to use and widely used. Also, both of our APIs have documentation present for Python so it is less work than having to convert it to another language. We decided on Flask because there is a lot of documentation on it and it is used in conjunction with Python. No other elements will be used in the prototype but we may look into other tools for the final project.
